       <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

       <ul>
        <li>3 Espresso ounces:</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Fresh Whole Milk:</li>
        <li>Sweetener i.e sugar 1 tea spoon (optional):</li>
        <li>Toppingsi.e cocoa or cinamon 1/2 tea spoon(optional):</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Brew the Espresso:
            Start by brewing a strong shot of espresso using your preferred method. You can use an espresso machine, a stovetop espresso maker, or any other espresso brewing equipment. Make sure to follow the instructions specific to your chosen method to achieve a rich and flavorful espresso shot.</li>


        <li>Steam the Milk:
            While the espresso is brewing, heat fresh milk in a small saucepan or using a milk frother. The ideal milk for a cappuccino is whole milk as it creates a creamy and velvety texture. Heat the milk over medium heat until it reaches a temperature between 150°F to 160°F (65°C to 70°C). Avoid overheating the milk, as it can affect the taste and texture.
            
            If you have an espresso machine with a steam wand, you can use it to steam the milk directly. Place the steam wand into the milk jug and position it just below the surface of the milk. Open the steam valve to create a gentle hissing sound, and move the jug in a circular motion to evenly heat the milk and create froth.</li>


        <li>Pour the Milk:
            Once the milk is steamed to your desired consistency, it's time to pour it into the espresso. Start by gently tapping the milk jug on a flat surface to remove any large bubbles and create a smooth texture. Then, slowly pour the steamed milk into the espresso, aiming to pour it from a slightly elevated position. This will help create a layered effect, with the milk and espresso blending together.
            
            Aim to pour one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third milk foam. The foam should sit on top of the milk and create a distinct layer. You can use a spoon to hold back the foam while pouring the milk and then scoop it on top.</li>


            <li>Add Optional Toppings:
            To enhance the flavor and visual appeal of your cappuccino, you can add optional toppings. Dust the milk foam with a sprinkle of cocoa powder, cinnamon, or any other desired topping. This adds a touch of sweetness and aroma to the beverage. Once prepared, your cappuccino is ready to be enjoyed. Sip it slowly to savor the harmonious blend of espresso, steamed milk, and frothy foam.</li>
      </ol>
